<h3>How to </h3>
Create a repository on GitHub (your-username/your-repo) <br>
Create a db.json file <br>
Visit https://my-json-server.typicode.com/your-username/your-repo to access your server <br>
No registration. Nothing to install. <br>

<h3>Example</h3>
You can check the following server as an example: <br>
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo <br>

<h3>Beta </h3>
For the moment, the project is in beta which means many things may change or break:<br>

URLs may change<br>
Service may be down<br>
Authentication may be added later<br>
etc...<br>
Use it at your own risk. If you need a reliable solution, please install JSON Server.<br>

<h3>Limits </h3>
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:<br>

Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)<br>
Requests are cached (1 minute)<br>
db.json has limits<br>
All servers are public<br>
Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)<br>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
I hope to be able to support private repositories later and plan to improve this service regularly. To be notified of updates, you can follow me on Twitter @typicode.
